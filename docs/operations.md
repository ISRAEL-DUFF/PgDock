# Operating PGDock

Day-to-day running of a PGDock install. Commands run in `deploy/compose`.

## Health at a glance

- **Alerts** (sidebar) lists what is wrong now; the same alerts go to your
  webhook and email (Settings → Alerts). Each is sent when it fires and when
  it resolves:

  | Alert | Severity | Fires when |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Backup failed | critical | A project's (or the metadata database's) latest backup failed |
  | Backup overdue | warning | A project older than 26 h has no successful backup in 26 h |
  | Restore test failed | critical | The latest weekly restore test failed |
  | Node disk | warning | A node's data disk is over 85% full |
  | Node unreachable | critical | A node's agent has not answered for 2+ minutes |
  | Project disk | warning | A project is larger than its disk warning (Project Settings → Database) |
  | Pooler down | critical | A PgBouncer's admin console does not answer |
  | Isolation check | critical | The nightly tenant-isolation check found a problem |

- **Operations** shows every long action with its step log.
- **Metrics** (per project and per node) charts size, connections, TPS,
  cache hit ratio, CPU, memory, disk, and I/O; `/metrics` serves them to
  Prometheus.
- `docker compose ps` and `docker compose logs <service>` for the
  containers themselves.

## Backups

- Logical backups of every project run nightly (02:00 UTC plus up to 2 h of
  jitter); dedicated instances also take daily base backups and archive WAL
  continuously (point-in-time recovery for 7 days).
- Retention: 7 daily backups and 4 weekly ones; final backups of deleted
  projects are kept 30 days.
- Weekly, a random project's latest backup is restored into a scratch
  database and verified (Settings → Backup checks).
- The metadata database backs itself up nightly to `<prefix>/metadata/`.
- Restores: a project's Backups tab → **Restore**, into a new project or in
  place (in place takes a safety backup first and needs re-authentication).

### Storage targets and project keys

Backups go to a **storage target**, an S3 bucket and prefix. **Platform
targets** (Settings → Platform storage targets) are yours to run; exactly
one is the default, used by every project that hasn't chosen another, and
backup storage on them counts against each organisation's
`backup_storage_mb` quota (manual backups beyond it are refused; nightly
ones still run). **Org targets** (Organisation → Backup storage, owners
and admins) are buckets an organisation brings itself: its projects can
use them, the storage doesn't count against its quota, and neither other
organisations nor you see them (the admin organisation list only counts
the projects using one). Adding or editing a target writes, reads, lists
and deletes a test object under its prefix first; credentials are sealed
with the master key and never shown again.

A project admin picks the target under **Backups → Storage**. New backups
go there; existing ones stay where they are and stay restorable, or can
be copied over (verified by checksum, originals deleted only if asked).
For a dedicated project the switch restarts the instance with WAL-G
pointed at the new target and takes a base backup at once; the previous
archive stays restorable for the 7-day recovery window, then goes.

**Use a project key** gives a project its own backup key: new backups are
OpenPGP messages to it, and on the dedicated tier WAL-G uses it too.
**Download key…** needs re-authentication, is audited, and gives a file
with a README on restoring with gpg and pg_restore alone
([disaster recovery](disaster-recovery.md#restoring-a-project-without-pgdock)).
A target can't be deleted while a project uses it; one that still holds
backups is deleted only when you accept that they become unrestorable. A
project whose backups are on its organisation's target moves to platform
storage before it can be transferred to another organisation.

## Security checks

Every shared cluster is checked nightly against the tenant-isolation
checklist (Settings → Tenant isolation, **Check now** to run it at once):
cluster settings and `pg_hba.conf`, every project's role and database, and
two throwaway tenants that try to reach each other, discover other
projects' names, get round their quotas, or log in while suspended. See
[security review](security-review.md).

## Users and organisations

Every user has a personal organisation and can be invited into others.
Organisation owners and admins manage members and see every project in
it; members see only the projects they are added to, as admin, developer,
or read-only. Each member gets their own database login per project
(Members → **Get my credentials**): `<db>_u_<id>`, read/write for admins
and developers, read-only for read-only members. Removing someone from a
project or organisation drops their logins and ends their connections at
once; the app's own `<db>_owner` password is never shared, so it never
needs rotating when people leave.

## Platform admins and recovery

The first account, made in the setup wizard, is the platform admin. Any
platform admin can make another account an admin (Admin → Users → **Make
admin**) or take the role away (**Remove admin**). Both ask for your
password and an authenticator code again. The account must be active,
approved, verified and have two-factor set up; it is signed out and emailed
when its role changes, and the last active admin can't be removed. Keep at
least two admins, so losing one phone never locks you out.

If nobody who is an admin can sign in, recover from the server, where you
already hold the metadata database and `.env`:

```sh
docker compose exec pgdock-server pgdock-server admin list
docker compose exec pgdock-server pgdock-server admin promote you@example.com
docker compose exec pgdock-server pgdock-server admin reset-2fa you@example.com
docker compose exec pgdock-server pgdock-server admin reset-password you@example.com
```

`promote` also approves, verifies and re-enables the account (it need not
have an authenticator yet; its next sign-in sets one up). `reset-2fa` removes
the authenticator and recovery codes, so the next sign-in sets up new ones.
`reset-password` prints a one-hour, single-use link for when email doesn't
work. `demote` makes an admin an ordinary user, and still refuses to remove
the last one. Each change is written to the platform audit log as done on the
server. Anyone who can run these commands already controls the database, so
guard that access like the master key.

As platform admin you manage accounts (Users: approve, disable, reset
two-factor after checking who they are), email, sign-up, and the terms.
You do not see into other people's organisations through the UI. The
audit logs are per project, per organisation (Audit log), and for the
platform (Platform audit).

Projects created before V2 are in the platform admin's personal
organisation, unchanged: same URLs, passwords, and backups.

## Quotas, storage locks and usage

Each organisation has a plan (Organisations → the org → Plan), with
per-key overrides; Plans lists and edits them. Creating projects, backups,
restores and console queries past a limit fails with the limit named.
Owners and admins see their use on **Usage & quotas**, with hourly
storage and a CSV export; you see every org's on the admin usage API.

Shared-tier projects are measured every minute:

- **90%** of the project's storage limit: a warning email and banner.
- **100%**: read-only by default. Apps can still delete in a read-write
  transaction (`BEGIN READ WRITE`), and the SQL console works.
- **120%** (or 100% with the node's disk 95% full): apps cannot log in.
  The console and table browser still work; delete data there, then
  **Reclaim space** (Project Settings → Database) to give the space back.

Locks lift at the next check once the project is under the limit.
Statements running over 10 minutes are cancelled and transactions idle
over 5 minutes are ended; the project's Metrics page lists them.

Dedicated instances beyond an org's allowance become requests (Dedicated
requests) for you to approve or reject. An org can be given its own
shared cluster (Organisations → the org → Shared cluster): its new
projects go only there, and nobody else's do.

## Suspension, break-glass and deletion

**Suspend** (Organisations → the org, with a reason) stops the org's
projects accepting connections and its backups, and makes the org
read-only for its members; **Reinstate** undoes it. **Outbound access**
can be turned off on its own, without suspending (see Outbound traffic).

To look inside an org (a support case), open a **break-glass** session
with a reason and a length (up to 4 hours). You act as an org admin; its
owners and admins are emailed, every action is in its audit log marked
break-glass, and they see a banner. End it when you are done.

Owners can delete an organisation (Organisation → Delete). It is
read-only for 7 days and can be cancelled; then each project gets a final
backup, kept for 30 days, and is deleted.

## Opaque names

New projects' databases and roles are named `p_<random>`, so other
tenants cannot learn them. Projects from before V2 are renamed on the
server side and keep their old name as an alias, so their URLs keep
working; their role name stays visible until an admin uses **Switch to
opaque credentials** (Project Settings → Database), which issues new URLs and keeps the old
ones working for a grace period. Members' personal database logins
(`<database>_u_<member>`) are renamed at once, with the same password: their
old user name stops working, so members copy the new connection string.

## The SQL Editor

The **SQL Editor** is laid out as Supabase Studio's. Queries run against
the live database as the project's owner role, at most 1,000 rows shown
per statement, with a 30-second timeout unless you pick a longer one; run
read-only from the role picker, and read-only members and projects whose
console is read-only always do. ⌘↵ runs the selection or everything,
⌘⇧F formats, and the editor completes schema, table and column names.
Long queries can be cancelled; errors are marked where Postgres found
them; results export as CSV or JSON.

Queries are saved as you type. Each member keeps their own (**Private**),
can share one with everyone who can use the project's console
(**Shared**), and marks favourites for themselves. Only a query's owner
edits it (others duplicate it to change it); project admins may also
delete shared ones. Saved queries are deleted with the project and move
with it to another organisation. The editor's run history stays in the
browser.

## The table editor

Project members edit data and schema in the **Table Editor**, laid out as
Supabase Studio's (developers and above; read-only members browse and
export). The sidebar lists the schema's tables, views and other objects,
each with a menu to edit, duplicate, copy the name of, export or delete
it; open tables stay as tabs. Rows: **Filter** and **Sort** (several
columns), pages of 100 to 1,000 with the record count (an estimate on big
unfiltered tables), and **Definition** shows the table's DDL.
Double-click a cell to edit it: the change saves at once, checked
against the column's type, and if someone changed the row since you
loaded it you get a "Someone changed this row" message instead of
overwriting their change. JSON cells open a larger editor; foreign-key
cells link to the row they reference. **Insert** adds a row or a column
from a side panel; select rows to delete them. Tables need a primary key
to be editable.

Schema changes (new table, edit table, add or edit a column, with
foreign keys, unique and check constraints) are made in side panels and
then reviewed: every change shows its SQL and risk notes first, such as
"Rewrites the table and blocks writes" for a type change, and runs with
a 5-second lock timeout, so it fails fast rather than queueing behind a
long transaction. Editing a table runs all its changes in one
transaction. Indexes build concurrently. Schema changes are in the
project's audit log with their SQL. **Save as migration** exports the
change as plain SQL, goose or dbmate, to apply to other environments.

## Branches

A branch is a throwaway copy of a project on the shared tier (on the
organisation's own shared cluster if it has one), from its latest backup
or live, schema only or with data. Developers and above create them under
**Database → Branches** or with `pgdock branch create`; they expire after
7 days unless given another TTL (1 hour to 30 days, or kept), the
creator is emailed a day before, and an hourly job deletes expired ones
without a final backup. **Reset** refills a branch from its parent while
keeping its database name, URL, password and members' logins;
**Detach** turns it into a standalone project (which can then be
promoted). A parent can't be deleted while it has branches, and a
branch can't have branches of its own.

Branches count toward the organisation's branch quota (10 on Personal,
25 on Team) but not its projects, and toward its shared storage; usage
records branch-hours and branch GB-hours. They take no nightly backups
unless a project admin turns them on (**Project Settings → General → Data**). Mark a
project **Contains sensitive data** (or make it the organisation's
default under **Organisation → Projects**) and its branches copy the
schema only, unless a project admin asks for the data. Webhooks and
scheduled jobs are never copied.

## API tokens and the CLI

Members use the `pgdock` CLI ([CLI guide](cli.md)) and API tokens for
scripts and CI. Tokens act in one organisation with read, write or admin
scope, optionally restricted to some projects, and expire within a year.
Set a lower maximum under **Settings → API tokens**. Organisation owners
and admins revoke their members' tokens under **Organisation → API
tokens**; suspending an organisation disables its tokens, and removing
someone revokes theirs. You can't see other people's tokens, and a
platform admin's own tokens can't manage the platform: use the browser
for that.

## Capacity

- The shared cluster's tuning is in `compose.yaml` (`SHARED_PG_SHARED_BUFFERS`,
  `SHARED_PG_EFFECTIVE_CACHE_SIZE` in `.env` for other host sizes). Each
  shared project gets a pool of 5 server connections in transaction mode and
  up to 20 backends; the load test ([load test](load-test.md)) ran 150
  projects with ten busy ones on 4 vCPU.
- When a project outgrows the shared tier (sustained load, a large
  database), **promote** it (Project Settings → Compute and tier): same URL,
  a short write freeze.
- When it no longer needs its own instance, **demote** it (Project Settings →
  Compute and tier → Move back to shared, or `pgdock demote`). The preflight checks the size
  against the organisation's shared storage limits, extensions against
  the shared allow-list, custom roles, peak connections, database
  settings that will reset, and a shared cluster with room for the
  database plus 20% (the organisation's own when it has one). The URL and
  every password stay the same; the guardrails go back to the shared
  defaults, the SQL console stays read-only unless asked, and
  point-in-time recovery ends: the project takes a logical backup at
  once and nightly after that, while the old base backups stay restorable
  for 7 days. The dedicated instance is stopped and kept for 48 hours as
  a rollback option (an operator can start it again from its volume),
  then destroyed by the hourly cleanup, which releases it from the
  organisation's dedicated allowance.
- Add nodes on the Nodes page; new shared projects go to the least loaded
  shared cluster, dedicated instances to the least loaded dedicated node.

## Outbound traffic

Webhooks and HTTP jobs are the only way tenants make PGDock send requests
([webhooks and scheduled jobs](webhooks.md)). Before each request
pgdock-server resolves the host and refuses private, loopback, link-local,
CGNAT and cloud-metadata addresses, then connects to the address it
checked, without following redirects. Add your nodes' network (and any
other internal range) with `PGDOCK_OUTBOUND_BLOCK=10.0.0.0/16,192.0.2.0/24`
if it isn't in a private range already.

On an organisation's admin page you can:

- **Allow-list internal hosts** for that organisation alone (a receiver on
  your own network, a local test server): listed hosts may resolve to
  private addresses and use plain `http://`. Link-local and metadata
  addresses can never be allowed. Tenants can't change the list.
- **Disable outbound traffic** without suspending the databases: webhook
  events queue and HTTP jobs are skipped until it is back on.
- See the organisation's requests per destination host over the last 30
  days (hosts and counts only, no payloads).

Only one pgdock-server delivers webhooks and runs the scheduler at a time
(advisory locks), so more servers can be added later without double
deliveries.

## Secrets

- `.env` holds `PGDOCK_MASTER_KEY`; keep a copy off the server.
- **Rotate the master key**: generate a new one, run the rotation, then
  switch over:

  ```sh
  new=$(docker compose exec -T pgdock-server pgdock-server -gen-master-key)
  old=$(grep '^PGDOCK_MASTER_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)
  docker compose stop pgdock-server
  docker compose run --rm -e PGDOCK_MASTER_KEY="$new" -e PGDOCK_MASTER_KEY_PREVIOUS="$old" \
    pgdock-server -rotate-master-key
  sed -i "s|^PGDOCK_MASTER_KEY=.*|PGDOCK_MASTER_KEY=$new|" .env
  docker compose up -d
  ```

  The rotation re-encrypts everything in one transaction and checks the new
  key alone opens it all; on any error nothing changes. Operators sign in
  again afterwards. Back up the new `.env`.
- The backup key never changes (old backups need it); keep it offline.
- `PGDOCK_CONSOLE_DISABLED=true` turns the SQL console and table browser
  off for every project.

## Upgrades and disaster recovery

- [Upgrading](upgrade.md)
- [Disaster recovery](disaster-recovery.md): rebuild the control node,
  restore the metadata, re-register agents, bring back project data.
